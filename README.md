# DevControl
A simple announcer and feedback portal.

## About
The primary function of DevControl is to provide a simple solution to letting concurrent players know that the server is operating under beta test protocol, informing them that the server can restart and shut down at any time (with advanced warning) as well as some bugs can surface during development.

Players are given an option and incentives to report bugs, issues and feedback through an external Google Forms link by typing a command in-game.
